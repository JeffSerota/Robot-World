# Robotworld continued

This is a continued version of [GamingComet](https://mods.factorio.com/user/GamingComet)'s [Robot World](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/robotworld). I have made a seperate mod because the original mod was not getting 0.18 version support. This mod will be removed if the original author requests it or the original mod gets updates.

This mod has been introduced by [XTerminator](https://www.youtube.com/@Xterminator) [Video Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYdQiyt5c_M)

* Leave suggestions and any bugs you encounter on the discussion page or Github. I respond within a few hours. If using Github, feel free to create branches with your improvements. I will test them and add them to the mod.

# Credits
* All original code/concepts credits goes to [GamingComet](https://mods.factorio.com/user/GamingComet)

# Other mod support

* I only played with this for vanilla and [AAI-Industry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-industry). I will try to add other mods if requested or needed as I play with other mods. Note that I am new to modding and the lua language so I may have difficulties adding other mods with specific robot related tech.
